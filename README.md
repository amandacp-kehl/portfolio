## Technologies Used

* HTML5

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Folder Structure

* `images`: Contains images used in the portfolio website.
* `style.css`: Contains the styles for the website.

## CSS Variables

The CSS uses several variables to define colors and fonts. These variables are defined in the `:root` selector of the `style.css` file.

* `--primary-color`: Background color for the body
* `--secondary-color`: Text color for most elements
* `--tertiary-color`: Accent color (orange)
* `--quaternary-color`: Secondary accent color (green)
* `--primary-font`: Font for headings
* `--secondary-font`: Font for body text

## Custom Classes

* `.header`: Styles the header section of the website.
* `.header__menu`: Styles the navigation menu inside the header.
* `.header__menu__link`: Styles the navigation links.
* `.presentation`: Styles the main content section of the website.
* `.presentation__content`: Styles the content container within the presentation section.

* `.presentation__links__subtittle`: Styles the subtitle for the contact links section.
* `.profile__picture`: Styles the profile picture.
* `.footer`: Styles the footer section of the website.
* `.secondary__pictures` (commented out): This class is not currently used in the code but defines styles for a rounded image with a border.

## Media Queries

The `style.css` file includes a media query that adjusts the layout for screens smaller than 1200px wide.

## Additional Notes

The commented-out class `.secondary__pictures` provides an example of how to create rounded images with borders using CSS. You can uncomment this class and modify it to add additional images to the portfolio.

I hope this README helps you understand the structure and functionality of the code for Amanda Kehl's portfolio website.
